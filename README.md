Why: Because Mental Health is just as important as physical health.
The Zen Den app is to help the everyday perso find their Zen. Sometimes we just need a little inparation. There is a lot out of help out there, but the Zen Den helps narrow the advice to help the user get the advice they need for their current mood. 
** Note** While I have the delete route built out for blog post, I think its best to not have the option available to users. We can't erase our emotions and the ability to see our personal past emotions allows us to be intorspective allowing use to become our best selves.

I did my wireframes on the web platform Figma. This is the link.

Shout Out to James and Ninti!!!!

In a future iteration of this project I would actually have the advice render on the profile page. I would also work on better styling. I would also have the most current blog post show up on the user page along with the mood status from when the post was written.
